Everyone is welcome to become a club member. We do not charge an admission fee at this time. 
Registered members will get a personal homepage on this website, where they may post a list of species they maintain and introduce to others about their fishkeeping hobby in general. 
Registered members may also post articles under our "Member Posts" section.

Our club meets on the 3rd Sunday every month at 10:30 A.M., where we hold a speaker presentation, an auction, and general discussion/socializing periods. Our meeting location:

**Boll Weevil at Lakeside, CA**
