Introduction
------------

This website serves as a joint platform for the San Diego Killifish Group and the San Diego Livebearer Group.
With a passionate group of hobbists for killifish and livebearers in the greater San Diego area, we created this website in the interest to share our resources and to broaden our public outreach.

The current fishkeeping community does not give killifish and livebearers the attention it deserves, and each group of species has their own issues with public appeal.
Whereas fishkeepers often perceive killifish as fragile and short-living, the livebearers see only a fraction of its diverse population in the general fish trade, with many fabulous and unique species and strains forgotten or hidden from the wider hobbist community.
By setting up this joint platform, we hope to demonstrate to the fishkeeping community the joyful idiosyncrasies and unrepeated beauty of these two species groups.
