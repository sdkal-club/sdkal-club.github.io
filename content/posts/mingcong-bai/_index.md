I live in a small (250 ft²) studio apartment, negotiating constantly with spatial (and other) constraints.  Fishkeeping is a way for me to find some time off my work and stresses as a history PhD student.

Most of my tanks are of 5.5 or 10 gallon sizes, all heavily planted with a deep sand bed, unheated, and filtered with sponge filters. All tanks (except for those housing Goodeids) uses various kinds of Corydoras as clean-up fish. Temperature fluctuates in my apartment throughout the day.
